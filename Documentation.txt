main contains API, which runs remotely at Render via Git (landingpage repository).
request contains code to ask API and get response (and later store response)

The user submits their input via POST /userInput, and we store it.
The AI processes the input asynchronously, then the user can retrieve the results using GET /getRecommendations/{user_id}.
This structure separates input collection from AI processing, making it scalable and efficient.
